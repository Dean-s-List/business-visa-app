## Description:

**1. Underdog NFTs - Dynamic, Unique, and Expressive:**
Upon completing our user-friendly onboarding form, participants are primed to receive a distinctive NFT powered by Underdog. These NFTs are more than static images; they're dynamic artworks that can evolve over time, with both the image and metadata being adjustable. This customization ensures that each NFT becomes an authentic representation of the holder's journey and contributions.


**2. Real-time Status Updates and USDC Earnings:**
The heart of our program lies in its ability to capture real-time interactions. Each NFT functions as a portal into the participant's engagement journey. A status indicator distinguishes between "active" and "expired" NFTs, signifying the participant's current involvement within the community. Additionally, USDC earnings, sourced from on-chain data, are showcased on the NFT, offering an instant glimpse of rewards earned through active participation.


**3. Custom Expiry and Renewal:**
NFTs come with a unique twist—expiration! Our system allows you to customize the duration of each NFT's active status (ours is set at 30 days by default). As the expiration date approaches, the NFT transitions to "expired" status. But fear not, the journey doesn't end there.


**4. Renewal with Sphere Pay:**
Expired NFT holders can rejuvenate their community journey through renewal. To ensure continuity and commitment, a renewal cost is introduced, payable in USDC. Thanks to a seamless integration with Sphere Pay's payment implementation, the renewal process becomes a breeze, enabling participants to effortlessly extend their community engagement.


**5. Non-Transferable Exclusive NFTs:**
The essence of these NFTs lies in their exclusivity. Each NFT is non-transferable, firmly anchoring it to the holder's identity and journey. This distinct feature reinforces authenticity, prevents resale, and underscores the value of active participation. Step into the future of decentralized community building with our Business Visa Program. Elevate your experience, engage authentically, and embrace the dynamic potential of blockchain technology. Your journey starts here—your NFT awaits.
